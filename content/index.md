## Vision for CreateWithLevi
- A vessel for my ideas to grow and to impact others
- For me, it's a playground. 
	- I want to link my ideas, make sense and also make use of them
	- I create whatever feels right at the moment. I may write in English, Chinese, or other languages that I'm learning.
- For the reader, enjoy watching my game, or create with me!

## Here's the home, come back when you feel lost
### What do you want to know?
- I am learning a variety of new topics. I want to share meaningful insights while I create. Things I really care about instead throwing tons of information to here.
### How do I create?
- A simple way that I'm using: 
	1. Set a vision for what you want to create, just like the above. 
	2. Set simple milestones and dates for what I want to achieve
	3. Plan simple actions for the next milestone
	4. Act and get results!
	5. Adjust the action plan, milestones and vision on the way
### Create with me!
- I am building my online presence, this website may become the creative center for it.
- I am building software products, it has become really fun for me after AI comes out.
- I am preparing to live abroad with my wife, here's my [[Live Abroad MOC|Note for Living Abroad]].
