> **Preface**  
> This article compiles my recent thoughts and conversations about "how to present both personal creative interests and professional image (such as product design, software development) in my Digital Garden."  
> Through the following context, you'll see my thinking on bilingual notes, portfolio, multi-platform distribution, and content creation perspectives, as well as potential action directions.

## I. Origins and Background

1. **Native Language vs. English Notes Decision**

   - I encounter information in both Chinese and English, with most learning materials being in English (technical documentation, blogs, videos), but my most natural language for thinking and writing remains Traditional Chinese.
   - When establishing Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) or Digital Garden, I want to balance my "thinking fluency" and "international information connection", thus planning to use **Native Language + English aliases** or bilingual notes approach.

2. **Combining Diverse Interests with Professional Needs**
   - I regularly research and document topics like "technology, travel, working abroad"; while also wanting to showcase my "product design/development capabilities" for job hunting or freelancing.
   - Previously, my Portfolio website only displayed project cases without sharing much about "how I think, how I execute". Now I want to put "in-depth processes and personal interests" in the Digital Garden, interconnecting with Portfolio and other social platforms.

## II. Bilingual Note Organization Strategy

1. **Native Writing with English Aliases**

   - In Obsidian or other notes, titles remain in Traditional Chinese for intuitive reading and review.
   - Add `aliases: ["English Title"]` in YAML or `[English Alias]` beside titles.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: 注意力管理
     aliases: [attention-management]
     ---
     ```
   - This supports English search while facilitating future international resource integration.

2. **Mixed Publishing Possibilities**
   - For technical or foreign resource-intensive notes, consider writing directly in English to reduce translation workflow.
   - Conversely, personal reflections and experiential content primarily in native language for better nuance.
   - Consider "bilingual versions" or brief translations for more formal "tutorials" or "blog posts".

## VIII. Conclusion

Through the above framework, I hope to maintain space for **"self-reflection and knowledge accumulation"** while providing an easily understandable **"professional image"** for potential readers or employers.

- **Digital Garden**: My "knowledge center", dynamically updating and integrating various topic notes.
- **Portfolio**: My "highlight showcase", making project outcomes immediately apparent.
- **External Platforms**: Selective "distribution and interaction", bringing continuous feedback and inspiration to my garden.

Looking forward to implementing these strategies and iterating on this foundation. If you have similar concerns or suggestions, feel free to connect with me. I'll continue incorporating feedback into the Digital Garden, enriching the entire knowledge landscape!
